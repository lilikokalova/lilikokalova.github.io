					<td>Andrew Prior was the father of Beatrice "Tris" Prior and Caleb Prior, and the husband of Natalie Prior. He was a member of the city Council, a group of Abnegation tasked in governing the city. He was like most Abnegation people, except for when his children left him. His wife described his reaction as being "selfish". However, in the end he still loved his children. Andrew Prior was born Erudite and his parents were friends of Jeanine Matthews's. He was a descendant of Edith Prior. Andrew was killed by a bullet wound at the end of Divergent.</td>
					<td>Natalie Prior was the mother of Tris and Caleb Prior, and the wife of Andrew Prior. She was born in Milwaukee, but as a result of a failed experiment, she was transferred to Chicago, and was originally part of Dauntless before she transferred to Abnegation.</td>
					<td>Marcus Eaton is the father of Tobias Eaton and leader of Abnegation. He was married to Evelyn Johnson-Eaton. He's the only living council member of Abnegation after the attack by the Erudite faction and the simulation-controlled Dauntless in Divergent.</td>
