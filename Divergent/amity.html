					<td width="500" VALIGN = Top Align = center>Johanna Reyes is the former representative/speaker of Amity and was the leader of the Allegiant. She transferred from Candor. Her most notable feature is a long scar running from her eye to her chin, rendering her blind in one eye, and rendering a lisp. It is said briefly in Allegiant that Tobias Eaton believes that she had gotten the scar from being abused by either her parents or a friend. It is never fully said however how she actually did receive the scar. It is believed that she got it when she had been in Candor. She left Amity to go with Marcus Eaton group, and later start the Allegiant.</td>
