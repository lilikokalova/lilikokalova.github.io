						<td>Beatrice "Tris" Prior is the main protagonist and narrator of the Divergent series. She is a strong-willed sixteen-year-old girl who hates showing weakness. Though Tris was born in the faction Abnegation, she eventually transferred to Dauntless and must face the fact that she is Divergent. When she arrived in her new faction, she opted for a change of name to go by. She decided to use Tris as a nickname for Beatrice, hoping for a fresh start in a new faction.</td>
						<td>Tobias Eaton, more prominently known as Four, is one of the main protagonists in the Divergent trilogy. He is the son of Evelyn Johnson and Marcus Eaton. Alongside Lauren (instructor of Dauntless-born initiates), he is the instructor of the transfer initiates. He becomes the love interest of Tris Prior later on in the first book of the trilogy. </td>
						<td>Christina is a Dauntless initiate who transferred from Candor and one of Tris Prior's best friends. She is portrayed by Zoe Kravitz a famous actress, in the Divergent movie.</td>

						<td>Tori Wu was a Dauntless member transfer from Erudite, who later became a vital and good friend to Tris Prior.ori Wu was the one who oversaw and administered Tris' aptitude test, discovering and telling her that she was a Divergent and the dangers and complications that came with being one.She is portrayed by actress Maggie Q in the Divergent movie.</td>
						<td>Uriah Pedrad was a Dauntless-born initiate who became a good friend of Tris Prior following her transfer from Abnegation. Like Tris, he was also Divergent. Uriah was a Dauntless born and thus, grew up in the Dauntless compound. Since his father died when he was young, his older brother, Zeke, who is also a member of Dauntless, became his father figure. He dated Marlene, another Dauntless member. Tobias Eaton, who was good friends with Zeke, soon became friends with Uriah. Zeke tells Tobias that Uriah has a drinking problem and this is proven when Tobias finds a flask under Uriah's pillow in Allegiant.</td>
						<td>Eric commands a group of Dauntless under the influence of the simulation serum to attack Candor headquarters, where the loyal Dauntless are congregated, and gas others so that they can be controlled by a simulation. They shoot tack-like things that inject a serum-like fluid into the loyal Dauntless and Candor members so they may be controlled later in simulations.  They also gas everyone, making them under effect of a sleep simulation, so they can find and capture Divergents, two of whom will be taken back to Erudite headquarters, while the rest will be killed. Eric shoots a young Divergent boy named Bobby in the head, but is then stabbed by Tris, and captured. When the loyal Dauntless learn that one of Erudite's 'peace' conditions for Candor staying safe is to hand over Eric safely to Erudite, the Dauntless rush to the room where he is being held and the newly elected Dauntless leaders, Tori Wu, Four, and Harrison, sentence him to death according to Dauntless rules. He requests Four to be his executioner, and asks Tris to list his crimes.</td>
